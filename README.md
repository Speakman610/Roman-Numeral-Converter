# Roman-Numeral-Converter
Used to convert roman numerals to integers. This file took me 70 minutes to write. It is executable in the command line and I can run it in my computer's terminal but I have no means to test it on windows. To run it in the command line simply type as follows:
python3 locationOfFile
locationOfFile being the path to the .py file as saved on your computer
